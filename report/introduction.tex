The aim of this coursework is to create and train decision trees in order to classify emotions using the state of 45 facial muscles.
There are 6 emotions, namely: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.
This report discusses our approach and findings. 
First,  we discuss the implementation of our model in Python.
Next, we turn to the analysis of our model using metrics such as confusion matrices or recall rates.
We conclude with an exploration of pruning techniques we could implement to increase the accuracy and precision of our model.
