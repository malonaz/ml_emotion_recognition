We have (regrettably) decided to implement our code in Python and as such, provide you with information on how to use our code.
If you run our code on a linux computer in the lab, there are no dependencies. If you run it on your computer, you must install \emph{dot}, to generate graphs. We have implemented a makefile to make your life easier and will proceed to explain the various commands available to you.

\emph{make all} will run all the following make.\\

\emph{make main} runs our main file src/main.py.\\

\emph{make graphs} will call src/main.py which will train trees, and generate png graphs of the decision trees, for vizualization purposes.
These are directly compiled in our latex report.\\

\emph{make report} will compile the report, which will be located in report/report.pdf.\\
