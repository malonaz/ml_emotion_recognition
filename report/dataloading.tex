We have create a data loader python module which serves two purposes:
First, it uses the scipy package to extract the data from one of the two datasets
such as \emph{cleandata\_student.mat}. It then separates the examples and labels
into two matrices.
Second, it has a function which maps a given labels matrix to a binary target on a given label,
such that a '1' indicates a positive label and a '0' indicates a negative label.
