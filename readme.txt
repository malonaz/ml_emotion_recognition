TODO
	majority values: case equality?


1) Implement class method for decision_tree_object.
   see page 14. bonus question.
   Although it's a bonus question, it's actually quite important because we will use it to debug.
   Google binary tree printing to standard output. It seems easy.. but it's actually very hard.
   your solution will most likely use recursion!

2) Error function
   see page 9
   This occurs after the tree has been trained. We must now test the tree on a validation data set,
   and evaluate the error rate.
   extra: implement a way to print the error rate like she did in class. see bottom page 9.

3) confusion matrix
   see page 10 and 15.


4) recall and precision rates
   see page 11


5) F_a measure
   see page 11 and 12.
